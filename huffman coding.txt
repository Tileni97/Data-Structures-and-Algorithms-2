Huffman coding is a powerful compression mechanism for communications transferred between clients. 
It efficiently decreases message size by assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less common ones. 
This adaptability provides efficient compression regardless of how the data is distributed. 
Huffman coding is quick in both compression and decompression procedures, keeping message integrity while avoiding data loss.
Its widespread support and long history make it a dependable choice for network communication.
